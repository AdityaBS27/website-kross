#### Project Details

The Link II system establishes Wide Area Network among Aircrafts and other
platforms with the fleet of Indian Navy over RF media (primarily) for exchange of ‘Tactical
Pictures’ and ‘Textual Messages’.

The project included converting CAD drawing into CATIA models. Besides, I was responsible for	designing and drafting of Chassis to house various modules, PCBs, in CATIA V5.
