#### Project

The project was to explore various machine learning techniques to estimate manufacturing cost of aircraft parts

#### Project Details


A data set containing 1000+ parts along with its machining requirement, machine time, labor cost and the material cost was provided. The challenge was to build a machine learning model to predict each cost (labour, machining and material cost). The major part of the time was utilized for preprocessing the data to train the model. I chose two models to preprocess and build a regression model for prediction. The pre-processing involved feature reduction and feature selection to reduce  28+ variables for prediction.The regression model built using filter and wrapper methods. and the  R^2 of both models could explain about 95 % of the variation.
