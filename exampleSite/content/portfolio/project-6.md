#### Project

A autonomous robot that could traverse in harsh and unknown terrain without any maps


#### Project Details

Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) allows a mobile robot to be completely move autonomously in an unknown environment and perform its tasks. The robot build up a map within an unknown environment at the same time keeping track of the current location and understanding of the environment with the help of sensory information. The robot is able to create a map of its environment and at the same time locate itself.  The Robot uses various sensors to measure the physical parameters in the environment. These measurements are fed to computer on a real time basis using Zigbee. The software in computer, using the data send by the robot maps the environment.
