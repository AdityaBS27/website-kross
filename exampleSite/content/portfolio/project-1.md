#### Project

The projects was in the Big data team at OEPC, where I was to explore various NLP techniques to guide and aid management to make better decisions.


#### Project Details

In this project developed a text and sentiment analysis to  analyse energy market behaviour using online tweets. Initially implemented a Social Network Analysis(SNA) and network visualisation of tweets and retweets to understand the online market  influencers in the energy market.

A dataset with online tweets concerning oil and natural gas markets were extracted, cleaned and assigned sentiments  to train the deep learning models. The data was trained on various deep learning models  such as LSTM, Bi-LSTM, TreeLSTM and Trandformers. The trained model was used to predict daily markets sentiments. These models along with sentiments were explore to forecasts oil prices and oil demand.
