I hail from Bangalore, the silicon valley of India. An interest in applied mathematics and an analytical mindset lead me to
a degree in Mechatronics Engineering, where I enjoyed building robots, working on assembly automation and mechanical design. This provided an opportunity to work at the Electronic warfare and Avionics department in the defense manufacturing industry in Bangalore. It was an exhilarating experience to work on Navy and Airforce telecommunication modules.

Following this, I took up a Master's program in Sweden to study Data Science and Financial Mathematics due to a change in career interest. After which, I have worked with various companies in data engineering, data science, and the development of novel machine learning models.

 I have traveled across many countries in lived in four.  I am an affable person who likes to explore cultures and countries. In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, traveling with friends, and reading. Eager to research and explore modern technologies to stay abreasted with current times. I relish challenges where I can explore and expand my knowledge boundaries.

I have about 3.5 years experience working across various industries. I am interested to pursue a career as a analytical consultant an work in the field of Data Science (Deep learning, Data engineering, and Business Intelligence) and Quantitative researches to aid clients across Europe.
